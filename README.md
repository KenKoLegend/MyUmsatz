Umsatz Manager [ WORK IN PROGRESS ]

This is a simple WPF application for managing financial transactions ("Umsatz" in German). It allows users to add, edit, and delete transactions, and view them in a tabular format. I am willing to learn more and more, so see this project as a simple project for learing purpouses.

Features
Add new transactions with a specific date, description, and amount.
Edit existing transactions to update their details.
Delete transactions that are no longer needed.
View transactions in a tabular format with options for customization.

Technologies Used

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the user interface.
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern for separation of concerns.
C# programming language for the application logic.
.NET Framework for runtime environment and libraries.

Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Open the solution file (UmsatzManager.sln) in Visual Studio.
Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the project.
Run the application using the debugger in Visual Studio or by executing the compiled executable.

Usage

Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with a table displaying existing transactions.
Use the "Add" button to create a new transaction, providing the necessary details.
Select a transaction from the table to edit or delete it using the corresponding buttons.
Customize the appearance or behavior of the application as needed by modifying the code or XAML files.
